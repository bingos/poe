=head1 NAME

POE::Pipe::OneWay - a portable API for one-way pipes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my ($read, $write) = POE::Pipe::OneWay->new();
  die "couldn't create a pipe: $!" unless defined $read;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The right way to create an anonymous pipe varies from one operating
system to the next.  Some operating systems support C<pipe()>.  Others
require C<socketpair()>.  And a few operating systems support neither,
so a plain old socket must be created.

POE::Pipe::OneWay will attempt to create a unidirectional pipe using
C<pipe()>, C<socketpair()>, and IO::Socket::INET, in that order.
Exceptions are hardcoded for operating systems with broken or
nonstandard behaviors.

The upshot of all this is that an application can portably create a
one-way pipe by instantiating POE::Pipe::OneWay.  The work of deciding
how to create the pipe and opening the handles will be taken care of
internally.

POE::Pipe::OneWay may be used outside of POE, as it doesn't use POE
internally.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=head2 new [TYPE]

Create a new one-way pipe, optionally constraining it to a particular
TYPE of pipe.  One-way pipes have two ends: a "read" end and a "write"
end.  On success, new() returns two handles: one for the "read" end
and one for the "write" end.  Returns nothing on failure, and sets $!
to explain why the constructor failed.

  my ($read, $write) = POE::Pipe::OneWay->new();
  die $! unless defined $read;

TYPE may be one of "pipe", "socketpair", or "inet".  When set,
POE::Pipe::OneWay will constrain its search to either C<pipe()>, a
UNIX-domain C<socketpair()>, or plain old sockets, respectively.
Otherwise new() will try each method in order, or a particular method
predetermined to be the best one for the current operating
environment.

=head1 BUGS

POE::Pipe::OneWay may block up to one second on some systems if
failure occurs while trying to create "inet" sockets.
