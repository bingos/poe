=head1 NAME

POE::Queue::Array - a high-performance array-based priority queue

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<POE::Queue>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is an implementation of the abstract POE::Queue interface.
As such, its documentation may be found in L<POE::Queue>.

POE::Queue::Array implements a priority queue using Perl arrays,
splice, and copious application of cleverness.

Despite its name, POE::Queue::Array may be used as a stand-alone
priority queue without the rest of POE.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<POE>, L<POE::Queue>

=head1 BUGS

None known.
