    # Neither Firefox 2.0 nor Lynx 2.8.5 set Content-Length on a GET

#   For compatibility with HTTP/1.0 applications, HTTP/1.1 requests
#   containing a message-body MUST include a valid Content-Length header
#   field unless the server is known to be HTTP/1.1 compliant. If a
#   request contains a message-body and a Content-Length is not given,

#   determine the length of the message, or with 411 (length required) if
#   it wishes to insist on receiving a valid Content-Length.

# PG- This seems to imply that we can either detect the length (but how
#     would one do that?) or require a Content-Length header.  We do the
#     latter.
#

=head1 DESCRIPTION

POE::Filter::HTTPD interprets input streams as HTTP 0.9, 1.0 or 1.1
requests.  It returns a HTTP::Request objects upon successfully
parsing a request.  

On failure, it returns an HTTP::Response object describing the
failure.  The intention is that application code will notice the
HTTP::Response and send it back without further processing. The
erroneous request object is sometimes available via the
L<HTTP::Response/$r-E<gt>request> method.  This is illustrated in the
L</SYNOPSIS>.

For output, POE::Filter::HTTPD accepts HTTP::Response objects and
returns their corresponding streams.

Please see L<HTTP::Request> and L<HTTP::Response> for details about
how to use these objects.

=head1 PUBLIC FILTER METHODS

POE::Filter::HTTPD implements the basic POE::Filter interface.

=head1 CAVEATS

Some versions of libwww are known to generate invalid HTTP.  For
example, this code (adapted from the HTTP::Request::Common
documentation) will cause an error in a POE::Filter::HTTPD daemon:

NOTE: Using this test with libwww-perl/5.834 showed that it added
the proper HTTP/1.1 data! We're not sure which version of LWP fixed
this. This example is valid for older LWP installations, beware!

  use HTTP::Request::Common;
  use LWP::UserAgent;

  my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new();
  $ua->request(POST 'http://example.com', [ foo => 'bar' ]);

By default, HTTP::Request is HTTP version agnostic. It makes no
attempt to add an HTTP version header unless you specifically declare
a protocol using C<< $request->protocol('HTTP/1.0') >>.

According to the HTTP 1.0 RFC (1945), when faced with no HTTP version
header, the parser is to default to HTTP/0.9.  POE::Filter::HTTPD
follows this convention.  In the transaction detailed above, the
Filter::HTTPD based daemon will return a 400 error since POST is not a
valid HTTP/0.9 request type.

Upon handling a request error, it is most expedient and reliable to
respond with the error and shut down the connection.  Invalid HTTP
requests may corrupt the request stream.  For example, the absence of
a Content-Length header signals that a request has no content.
Requests with content but not that header will be broken into a
content-less request and invalid data.  The invalid data may also
appear to be a request!  Hilarity will ensue, possibly repeatedly,
until the filter can find the next valid request.  By shutting down
the connection on the first sign of error, the client can retry its
request with a clean connection and filter.

=head1 Streaming Media

It is possible to use POE::Filter::HTTPD for streaming content, but an
application can use it to send headers and then switch to
POE::Filter::Stream.

From the input handler (the InputEvent handler if you're using wheels,
or the ClientInput handler for POE::Component::Server::TCP):

  my $response = HTTP::Response->new(200);
  $response->push_header('Content-type', 'audio/x-mpeg');
  $_[HEAP]{client}->put($response);
  $_[HEAP]{client}->set_output_filter(POE::Filter::Stream->new());

Then the output-flushed handler (FlushEvent for POE::Wheel::ReadWrite,
or ClientFlushed for POE::Component::Server::TCP) can put() chunks of
the stream as needed.

  my $bytes_read = sysread(
    $_[HEAP]{file_to_stream}, my $buffer = '', 4096
  );

  if ($bytes_read) {
    $_[HEAP]{client}->put($buffer);
  }
  else {
    delete $_[HEAP]{file_to_stream};
    $_[KERNEL]->yield("shutdown");
  }

=head1 SEE ALSO

Please see L<POE::Filter> for documentation regarding the base
interface.

The SEE ALSO section in L<POE> contains a table of contents covering
the entire POE distribution.

L<HTTP::Request> and L<HTTP::Response> explain all the wonderful
things you can do with these classes.

=head1 BUGS

Many aspects of HTTP 1.0 and higher are not supported, such as
keep-alive.  A simple I/O filter can't support keep-alive, for
example.  A number of more feature-rich POE HTTP servers are on the
CPAN.  See
L<http://search.cpan.org/search?query=POE+http+server&mode=dist>
