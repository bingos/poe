=head1 NAME

POE::Driver::SysRW - buffered, non-blocking I/O using sysread and syswrite

=head1 SYNOPSIS

L<POE::Driver/SYNOPSIS> illustrates how the interface works.  This
module is merely one implementation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This driver implements L<POE::Driver> using sysread and syswrite.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

POE::Driver::SysRW introduces some additional features not covered in
the base interface.

=head2 new [BlockSize => OCTETS]

new() creates a new buffered I/O driver that uses sysread() to read
data from a handle and syswrite() to flush data to that handle.  The
constructor accepts one optional named parameter, C<BlockSize>, which
indicates the maximum number of OCTETS that will be read at one time.

C<BlockSize> is 64 kilobytes (65536 octets) by default.  Higher values
may improve performance in streaming applications, but the trade-off
is a lower event granularity and increased resident memory usage.

Lower C<BlockSize> values reduce memory consumption somewhat with
corresponding throughput penalties.

  my $driver = POE::Driver::SysRW->new;

  my $driver = POE::Driver::SysRW->new( BlockSize => $block_size );

Drivers are commonly instantiated within POE::Wheel constructor calls:

  $_[HEAP]{wheel} = POE::Wheel::ReadWrite->new(
    InputHandle => \*STDIN,
    OutputHandle => \*STDOUT,
    Driver => POE::Driver::SysRW->new(),
    Filter => POE::Filter::Line->new(),
  );

Applications almost always use POE::Driver::SysRW, so POE::Wheel
objects almost always will create their own if no Driver is specified.
